# University-of-Electronic-Science-and-Technology-of-China-Bachelor-Thesis-Overleaf for International Undergraduate Students
Well detailed Overleaf Latex version of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) Bachelor Thesis for International Undergraduate students who wish to format their final year thesis using overleaf latex template rather than the traditional methods which can be stressful and challenging.

# Description
UESTC Thesis Format for International Undergraduate Students has always been in word doc. template which makes it difficult for final year undergraduate international students to meet up with all the necessary formats. To this, I have rewritten the latex format to suit the International undergraduate students.
